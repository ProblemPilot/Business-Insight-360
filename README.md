Business Insights 360 for AtliQ Hardware: From Chaos to Clarity
This project showcases AtliQ Hardware's journey, a fast-growing hardware company, as they transitioned from Excel to the powerful data analysis tool, Power BI. By leveraging data-driven insights, AtliQ Hardware is now making smarter decisions across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain.

Empowering AtliQ Hardware with Data

AtliQ Hardware previously relied on spreadsheets, but this project demonstrates the transformative power of Power BI. Here's a glimpse into what they achieved:

Robust Data Source: A well-structured MySQL database stores everything from customer information and product details to sales data, forecasts, and even pricing details (including gross prices and pre/post-invoice deductions).
Advanced Power BI Techniques: We built insightful reports using features like:
Calculated Columns & DAX Measures: These unlock deeper analysis by manipulating data in powerful ways.
Star Schema Data Model (Snowflake Method): This ensures efficient data relationships for optimal report performance.
Interactive Dashboards: Engaging visuals present data clearly, making insights easy to grasp.
User-Friendly Navigation: Bookmarks, buttons, and other interactive elements provide a smooth experience.
KPIs & Conditional Formatting: Key metrics are highlighted for instant attention.
Power BI Service Integration: Reports are published for wider access and collaboration across departments.
Delivering Tangible Results

This project yielded practical benefits for AtliQ Hardware:

Functional Power BI Reports: Interactive dashboards cater to the specific needs of each department.
Published Reports in Power BI Service: Easy sharing and collaboration ensure everyone stays on the same page.
Business Language for Clear Communication:

The project incorporates essential business terms for accurate financial analysis. These include:

Gross Price
Pre-Invoice Deductions
Post-Invoice Deductions
Net Invoice Sale
Gross Margin
Net Sales
Net Profit
COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
YTD (Year-to-Date)
YTG (Year-to-Go)
YOY (Year-over-Year)
Data Model: The Foundation of Insights

The project emphasizes the importance of a well-structured data model. We opted for the star schema (Snowflake method) to ensure efficient data relationships for optimal report performance.
